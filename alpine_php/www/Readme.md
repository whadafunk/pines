# PHP Server Diagnostics Page

This project is a **self-contained PHP diagnostics and monitoring tool** that displays detailed information about the server, client, and request/response flow.  
It is styled with a **dark, easy-on-the-eyes theme** and organized into **collapsible sections** for clarity.

### ðŸ”¹ Collapsible Sections
1. **Request Details**
   - Request method
   - Query parameters
   - Request headers
   - Cookies

2. **Response Headers**  
   - All headers returned by the server

3. **Server Info**
   - Web server version
   - PHP version
   - Installed PHP modules
   - OS version
   - Kernel version
   - Uptime

## HAProxy Support

If the server is behind HAProxy, you may want to expose **X-Forwarded-For** and **X-Forwarded-Proto** headers.  
Example config snippet for HAProxy:

```haproxy
frontend http-in
    bind *:80
    default_backend servers

backend servers
    server web1 127.0.0.1:81 check
    http-request set-header X-Forwarded-For %[src]
    http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
```

The PHP script will display this info under **HAProxy-Specific Info**.

---

## Styling

- **Dark theme** with soft contrast
- **Bold key labels** with color distinction from values
- **Collapsible panels** with smooth toggle animations
- **Copy-to-clipboard** buttons for headers and code blocks

---

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+ (tested with PHP 8.3)
- Apache / Nginx with PHP enabled
- Optional: HAProxy, HTTPS with SSL termination

---

## Usage

1. Place the `index.php` file on your server (e.g., `/var/www/html/diagnostics/index.php`).
2. Open it in your browser: `http://yourserver/diagnostics/`
3. Navigate through collapsible sections to explore details.

---

## Notes

- Memory usage and CPU load are calculated at runtime (specific to PHP process).
- Apache directives may be available only if `apache_get_version()` and related functions are supported.
- SSL details require HTTPS context.
